# Open Telco

This repository is a suite of telco-specific benchmarks.

Our goal is to create a centralised hub where telco evaluations can be maintained and run locally.

📚 [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) · 🏃 [Running Evaluations](docs/running-evaluations.md) · 📋 [List of Evals](docs/eval-list.md) · 📝 [Blog Post](https://huggingface.co/blog/otellm/gsma-benchmarks-02)

We are particularly excited about developing evaluations that are realistic and address the complementary capabilities necessary to ensure safe and optimal deployment of AI in a telco environment.
If you share this mission, please [reach out](mailto:emolero@gsma.com), we are always looking for collaborators and contributors!

This project is built on [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/), we encourage everyone to familiarise themselves with the framework, it's rapidly becoming the standard evaluation framework across top AI research institutions.
